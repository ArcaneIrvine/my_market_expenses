# My market expenses
Simple script made with python that plots my market expenses, how much i spend on average everytime i go to the market and how many times i buy each product. Anyone can use it by simply writing down their market spendings in the same format as the 'market_data' file inside the data folder. Simply then run the script and the plots will automatically get saved in the figures folder where you can study them!
